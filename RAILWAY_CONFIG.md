# Railway Configuration
# Railway needs individual services, not docker-compose.yml
# Configure each service in Railway dashboard to use its Dockerfile

# For Rocket.Chat service:
# - Root Directory: /
# - Dockerfile Path: Dockerfile.rocketchat

# For Prometheus service:
# - Root Directory: /
# - Dockerfile Path: Dockerfile.prometheus

# For Grafana service:
# - Root Directory: /
# - Dockerfile Path: Dockerfile.grafana

# Railway will create separate services from the same repo
# Each service uses its own Dockerfile
