# Railway MCP Configuration Complete ✅

## Configuration Updated

Railway MCP server is now configured with your API token:
- Token: `6dfae00a-ea5c-4725-9b75-02c9f32fe28a`
- Configuration file: `/Users/fidelis/.cursor/mcp.json`

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Cursor** - Required for MCP server to pick up the new token
2. **Verify MCP is working** - After restart, Railway MCP tools should be available
3. **Deploy email-proxy** - We can then use Railway MCP to manage services

## After Restart

Once Cursor restarts, Railway MCP will be able to:
- Deploy services programmatically
- Set environment variables
- Check service status
- View logs
- Manage deployments

## Current Status

✅ Railway MCP configured with API token
⏳ Need to restart Cursor for changes to take effect
⏳ email-proxy service needs GitHub repo connection (can do via MCP after restart)
